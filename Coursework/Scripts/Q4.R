# Looking at the grouped bar graph, we can see that Nitrogen oxides as nitrogen dioxide is 
# by far the largest pollutant as it is in most cases throughout the year. And Nitrogen oxide
# seems to be the least. The highest level was during the month of January. During the middle 
# of the year the averages were the lowest, might be due to the covid restriction. But afterwards 
# there is increase in levels amongst all the pollutant. This also suggests that there are other
# factors beside vehicles that can lead to these pollutants level being present, as this was 
# during the lock down.
